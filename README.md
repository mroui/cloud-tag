## Introduction
**Cloud Tag** is an application that helps create **your own cloud of words picture**.
</br></br>
**All you need** is a **website URL** that will extract the *words and tags*, and a **picture** that will be *base* of your cloud.
</br></br>
It is available to **customize the settings** according to your preferences, like: *colors*, *words amount* and *length*, *font size* or *space between tags*.
</br></br>
**The great convenience** is to include words that you do not want to use.
</br></br>
The main advantage is a **modern design** of application with **frameless style**. The whole looks **neat and minimalistic**.
</br></br>
It is an **desktop, window application** created in **Java** using **JavaFX** with **JSoup**, **Kumo** and **SLF4J** libraries. Application was tested on *Windows 10 64bit*.

*Project was made for passing the subject in college, but it was so interesting, that I willingly developed it with additional properties.*
